description: Answer an API or behavior question about a dependency from authoritative source by reading installed code, the published npm artifact, or the upstream repository at the pinned version before ever trusting docs.
argument-hint: "<package> [symbol] [@version]"
---

## Context

JavaScript lockfile: !`for f in pnpm-lock.yaml yarn.lock package-lock.json bun.lock bun.lockb; do if test -f "$f"; then echo "$f"; exit 0; fi; done; echo "(none)"`

node_modules directory: !`test -d node_modules && echo "present" || echo "(none)"`

## Instructions

Pick the ladder rung that matches the question, prove the answer in real source at an exact version, and report the answer with the rung and version that proved it.

### Process

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` (a package name, an optional symbol, and an optional `@version`; without a version, use the installed or lockfile-pinned one). Classify the question before touching anything: "does this exist in our version" or "why does our build fail" starts at rung L0; "what shipped in published version V" or "when did behavior change" starts at rung L1; "how or why does it behave", maintainer intent, or unreleased work starts at rung L2. Docs are never the starting rung.
2. L0 installed: read `node_modules/<pkg>/package.json` for the exact version, then the shipped type declarations and JS under its `dist`. This is the compatibility authority for what the project can actually import; no upstream read overrides it for import and typecheck questions. See [references/rungs.md](references/rungs.md) for the exact commands at this and every later rung.
3. L1 published artifact: in a scratch directory outside the repository, run `npm pack <pkg>@<ver> --ignore-scripts`, extract it, and search the extracted `package/`. This catches the case where docs claim an API the artifact does not ship. Loop over a short list of versions to bisect a behavior change.
4. L2 upstream source: resolve the repository from the package's `repository` field, resolve the release tag for the target version (tag naming varies, probe `v<ver>` then `<ver>`), then fetch single files with `gh api` at that ref, or shallow clone into scratch for cross-file tracing. Always pin the ref; the default branch describes a future version, not the one installed.
5. L3 docs last, to confirm intended usage or find examples, never as proof an API exists or behaves as described.
6. Stop at the first rung that answers the question. Report the answer with the rung, the exact version or ref, and the file that proved it.

### Rules

- Never assert an API exists or behaves a certain way from docs or from memory; every claim names the rung and version that proved it.
- `npm pack` always runs outside the repository tree and always with `--ignore-scripts`.
- Upstream reads always pin a tag or commit, never the default branch head.
