description: Run a multi-round parallel verification sweep over recent work or a whole repository, tracking findings in a fix ledger and looping fix and re-verify rounds until a round comes back clean.
argument-hint: "[scope] [--rounds <n>] [--agents <n>]"
---

## Context

Current branch and status: !`git branch --show-current; git status --short | head`

Commits ahead of the default base: !`git log $(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo main)..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null || echo "(none or base not found)"`

Existing ledger: !`test -f fix.md && echo "yes, resume it" || echo "(none)"`

## Instructions

Sweep the scope with parallel verification agents covering distinct angles, track every finding in a fix ledger, fix and re-verify until a full round finds nothing new, and never let the ledger or a weakened check ship.

### Process

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` (scope is a path, a feature, or `all`, defaulting to the work since the default base when on a feature branch and the whole repository otherwise; `--rounds` caps the loop, default 5; `--agents` sets verifiers per round, default 5). Resume an existing `fix.md` ledger instead of starting over.
2. Write the ledger `fix.md` at the repository root: numbered findings, each with status open, fixed, or rejected, its evidence, and the round it surfaced in. Follow [references/rounds.md](references/rounds.md) for the exact ledger format.
3. Run a round: dispatch the round's verification agents in one parallel batch, each covering a distinct angle (functional correctness, convention conformance, rendered UI when the scope has UI, tests and types, docs and dead surface); every agent returns concrete findings with file and line evidence. A non-trivial claim needs two independent verifiers, because a single verifier's confirmation is unreliable. See [references/rounds.md](references/rounds.md) for the full angle menu and dispatch mechanics.
4. Triage into the ledger: confirmed findings open, refuted findings rejected with the stated reason, duplicates merged into the earliest entry.
5. Fix every open finding, independent fixes in parallel, then re-verify each fix with a fresh check before flipping it to fixed; a fix that has not been re-verified stays open.
6. Loop to step 3 with fresh angles and fresh eyes until a full round yields zero new confirmed findings, or the round cap hits; hitting the cap is a reported outcome, not a silent stop.
7. Close out: report rounds run, findings found, fixed, and rejected, and any remaining risk. Delete `fix.md` once the report carries its content; the ledger is working state.

### Rules

- Never weaken, skip, or delete a failing check to make a round converge.
- A UI finding needs render evidence, not code reading alone; compose `verify-ui` when it is installed.
- Never commit `fix.md`; remove the ledger first if a commit is later requested.
