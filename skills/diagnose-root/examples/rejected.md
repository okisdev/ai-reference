# Rejected report

A reply that sounds decisive, passes the suite, and gets undone by the user. It answers the same failing test as the diagnosis example. Compare yours against it before posting.

Found it. The "totals without a coupon" test was asserting the wrong thing, so I updated it to expect 90, and I added `coupons.length = 0` in a `beforeEach` to be safe. All tests pass now. It was probably a caching issue. I also tidied up a few other things in `cart.js` while I was there.

Why each part fails:

- The whole reply is an edit: the ask was why, and a why question ends at the diagnosis with nothing changed (seen: a why question was answered with an edit).
- `updated it to expect 90`: the assertion was the oracle and was right; changing it to the buggy value hides the failure instead of explaining it.
- `coupons.length = 0` in a `beforeEach`: a patch at the symptom site that turns the suite green while carts keep sharing one list; a workaround ships only with the rejected root fix and the reason recorded.
- `All tests pass now`: no reproduction was shown before the edit and no rerun after it; show the exact failing command and its output on a clean tree, twice, then the same command after a fix that was asked for.
- `probably a caching issue`: a guess delivered as the answer, and nothing in the code caches anything; a mechanism without an observed reproduction is labeled a hypothesis, and it names the origin as file and line.
- `a few other things in cart.js while I was there`: changes nobody asked for, in a reply to a question.
